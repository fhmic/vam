/**
 * AUDIT NOTE (Phase 1A Final Production Readiness Audit, Phase 3 — Soft
 * Delete Audit): migration 0009 added profiles.deleted_at but, before
 * this fix, NOTHING in the app ever read it — a soft-deleted user could
 * still authenticate, complete onboarding, and use every protected
 * route normally, because RLS scopes rows by `auth.uid()` only and does
 * not know about `deleted_at` at all.
 *
 * There is still no deletion API route in Phase 1A (that's explicitly
 * deferred — see migration 0009's comment and the README), so today the
 * only way a row gets `deleted_at` set is direct DB/service-role access
 * (e.g. manual support action). But since that path exists, the app
 * must not silently keep serving a marked-deleted account. This is the
 * minimal safe-for-production check: the authenticated shell (which
 * every protected route renders inside of) treats a non-null
 * `deleted_at` as equivalent to "not signed in" — it force-signs-out
 * and redirects, rather than rendering anything.
 *
 * This intentionally does NOT filter deleted users out of any list/
 * query elsewhere in the app — there are no user-list or admin-facing
 * queries yet in Phase 1A to filter. That's tracked as future work once
 * back-office tooling exists (see docs/PHASE-1A-FINAL-AUDIT.md, Phase 3).
